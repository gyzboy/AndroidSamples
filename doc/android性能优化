一、Launch Time
1、API 19之后,logcat中有Displayed TAG的log,这个时间是从加载进程到完成整个activity界面绘制的时间,包括
Launch process->Initialize object->create and initialize activity->inflate layout->draw application

2、使用adb shel am start -S -W com.android.settings/com.oppo.settings.SettingsActivity

3、手动调用reportFullyDrawn()告诉系统已完成绘制

二、内存管理
1、实现ComponentCallbacks2回调
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity
    implements ComponentCallbacks2 {

    // Other activity code ...

    /**
     * Release memory when the UI becomes hidden or when system resources become low.
     * @param level the memory-related event that was raised.
     */
    public void onTrimMemory(int level) {

        // Determine which lifecycle or system event was raised.
        switch (level) {

            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN:

                /*
                   Release any UI objects that currently hold memory.

                   The user interface has moved to the background.
                */

                break;

            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_MODERATE:
            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW:
            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL:

                /*
                   Release any memory that your app doesn't need to run.

                   The device is running low on memory while the app is running.
                   The event raised indicates the severity of the memory-related event.
                   If the event is TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL, then the system will
                   begin killing background processes.
                */

                break;

            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND:
            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE:
            case ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE:

                /*
                   Release as much memory as the process can.

                   The app is on the LRU list and the system is running low on memory.
                   The event raised indicates where the app sits within the LRU list.
                   If the event is TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE, the process will be one of
                   the first to be terminated.
                */

                break;

            default:
                /*
                  Release any non-critical data structures.

                  The app received an unrecognized memory level value
                  from the system. Treat this as a generic low-memory message.
                */
                break;
        }
    }
}

2、使用Dragger2,Dragger2依赖注入在编译期运行意味着在运行期使用不需要额外的内存使用
